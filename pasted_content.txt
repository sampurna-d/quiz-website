"Manus, please create a responsive, user-friendly website that hosts an 8-question personality quiz. Each question should have four options (A, B, C, D), leading to one of four distinct results based on the most selected answer type. After completing the quiz, users should be presented with their result and a call-to-action button labeled 'Learn how to fix your broken window ðŸ§¹'. Clicking this button should initiate a Stripe Checkout session for a digital product (PDF). Upon successful payment, users should be redirected to a confirmation page where they can download the PDF.â€‹

Ensure the website is optimized for all devices and deploy it to a free hosting platform, providing me with the accessible URL upon completion."â€‹
