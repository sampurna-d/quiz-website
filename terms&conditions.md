# Terms and Conditions

**Effective Date:** 4/11/2025

Welcome to Chobify ("we", "us", "our"). By watching our videos, taking our quiz, or purchasing a personalized guide, you agree to these Terms. If not, that’s totally fine—just don’t use the site or buy the stuff.

### 1. What We Offer

We provide:

- Free content on platforms like YouTube and TikTok
- A personality quiz for entertainment and insight purposes
- Optional digital products tailored to quiz results

We're not therapists, psychics, or life gurus (yet). Everything we provide is for educational or entertainment purposes only.

### 2. Digital Products

When you purchase a guide, you’re buying a *non-refundable* digital download made just for you. We can’t offer refunds unless something went wrong technically (like if the file didn’t send—then hit us up).

### 3. Intellectual Property

All videos, quizzes, guides, and other content belong to us. You can enjoy it personally, but don’t repost, resell, or copy it without permission.

### 4. No Weird Stuff

Please don’t hack, reverse-engineer, or mess with the quiz. Also don’t use fake info or pretend to be someone else.

### 5. Updates

We may update these Terms. When we do, we’ll change the date above. Keep checking back if you’re the curious type.
