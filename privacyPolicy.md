# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: 4/11/2025**

We care about your privacy, and we’re not out here trying to be data goblins.

### 1. What We Collect

- Info you give us when you take the quiz (email, quiz answers)
- Purchase info if you buy a guide (through Stripe, etc.)
- Basic analytics (views, clicks, etc.)

### 2. How We Use It

We use your info to:

- Send you your quiz results and guide
- Improve the quiz and videos
- Occasionally email you something useful (if you opt in)

### 3. What We Don't Do

- We don’t sell your data
- We don’t spam
- We don’t track you across the web like a creep

### 4. Third-Party Tools

We may use tools like:

- Google Analytics (for traffic)
- Email providers (for quiz results + updates)
- Payment processors (like Stripe/Gumroad)

They have their own privacy policies—check those too if you’re curious.

### 5. Your Rights

You can request your data, ask us to delete it, or opt out of any marketing emails. Just email us at business.uahd@gmail.com
