      <p className="font-medium text-muted-foreground mb-8"><strong>Effective Date: 4/11/2025</strong></p>
      <p className="mb-6">Welcome to Chobify ("we", "us", "our"). By watching our videos, taking our quiz, or purchasing a personalized guide, you agree to these Terms. If not, that's totally fine—just don't use the site or buy the stuff.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">1. What We Offer</h3>
      <p className="mb-2">We provide:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Free content on platforms like YouTube and TikTok</li>
        <li>A personality quiz for entertainment and insight purposes</li>
        <li>Optional digital products tailored to quiz results</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-6">We're not therapists, psychics, or life gurus (yet). Everything we provide is for educational or entertainment purposes only.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Digital Products</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">When you purchase a guide, you're buying a <em>non-refundable</em> digital download made just for you. We can't offer refunds unless something went wrong technically (like if the file didn't send—then hit us up).</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Intellectual Property</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">All videos, quizzes, guides, and other content belong to us. You can enjoy it personally, but don't repost, resell, or copy it without permission.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">4. No Weird Stuff</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">Please don't hack, reverse-engineer, or mess with the quiz. Also don't use fake info or pretend to be someone else.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">5. Updates</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">We may update these Terms. When we do, we'll change the date above. Keep checking back if you're the curious type.</p>
